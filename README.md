# API Basejump: Chart the Stock Market (Work in progress)

A NodeJS App that allows users to search for stocks and see their recent trend. The app uses web sockets, so you can see other users add stocks in real time.

You can view the live demo here:

### The Web App Does the Following:
* As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
* As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
* As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
* As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
* As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
* As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
